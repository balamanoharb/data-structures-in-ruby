    - Binary Tree
    - Binary Search Tree
        - Self Balancing Trees
            - AVL Tree
            - Red Black Tree
            - Interval Tree
            - Splay Tree
            - B - Tree
    - Trie ( Prefix Tree )
        - Ternary Search Tree
        - Radix Tree
    - Suffix Tree
    - Fenwick Tree / Binary Indexed Tree
    - Segment Tree
