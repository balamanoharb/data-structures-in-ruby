## Description

This is a naive implementation of datastructures and algorithms for learning and experimenting.

>Disclaimer : This is not intended for production usage.

### Stack

- LIFO (Last In First Out)
- only allowed operations are push and pop

| Operation | Time Complexity | Additional info |
|-----------|-----------------|-----------------|
| push      |    O(1)         | adds an element |
| pop       |    O(1)         | removes the last element and returns it |
| peek      |    O(1)         | returns the last element or nil      |
| search    |    O(n)         | has to pop all elements in wors case |
| empty?    |    O(1)         | returns true or false                |
| size      |    O(1)         | returns the current size of stack    |
| full?     |    O(1)         | returns true or false - if the capacity is full |

### Queue / FIFO (First In First Out)
