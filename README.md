This is a naive implementation of standard datastructures for learning.

The following data structures will be implemented.

- Stack
    - [x] Array Based
    - [ ] Object Based
- Queue
    - [x] Array Based
    - [ ] Object Based
- Singly Linked List
    - Array Based
    - Object Based
- Doubly Linked List
    - Object Based
- [ ] Skip List
- [ ] Hash Table
- Heaps
    - [x] MinHeap - based on complete binary heap
    - [x] MaxHeap - based on complete binary heap
    - [ ] Binomial Heap - based on binomial tree
    - [ ] Fibonacci Heap
- [ ] Priority Queue
- [ ] Bloom Filters
- [ ] Graphs
    - [ ] Directed
    - [ ] Un-Directed
- [ ] Disjoint Set
- Trees
    - [ ] N-ary Tree
    - [ ] Binary Tree
    - [ ] Binary Search Tree
        - [ ] Self Balancing Trees
            - [ ] AVL Tree
            - [ ] Red Black Tree
            - [ ] Interval Tree
            - [ ] Splay Tree
            - [ ] B - Tree
    - Trie ( Prefix Tree )
        - [ ] Ternary Search Tree
        - [ ] Radix Tree
    - [ ] Suffix Tree
    - [ ] Fenwick Tree / Binary Indexed Tree
    - [ ] Segment Tree
    - [ ] B Trees
    - [ ] B+ Trees
